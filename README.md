# TBM_advance_classification
Code and data repository for the paper "Challenges and Opportunities of data driven hard rock TBM advance classification"

## Requirements

The environment is set up using `conda`.

To do this create an environment called `TBM_data` using `environment.yaml` with the help of `conda`. If you get pip errors, install pip libraries manually, e.g. `pip install pandas`
```bash
conda env create --file environment.yaml
```

Activate the new environment with:

```bash
conda activate Jv
```
